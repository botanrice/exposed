      <p><u>Questions</u></p>
      <p><b>What question was I exploring?</b></p>
      <p>
        Midjourney offers moodboards and I think fine tuning image gen models will be the future of visual art. 
        The entire premise of Are.na is people making moodboards, 
        what if we could turn any Are.na channel into a moodboard you can fine tune with?
      </p>
      <p><b>What did I learn?</b></p>
      <p>
        Fine tuning a default image gen model is quite easy programmatically and, 
        in the case of Google gemini-flash-2.5-image, doesn't even take 10 images to gen something quality.
      </p>
      <!-- <p><b>Why did it take this form?</b></p>
      <p>
        Most straightforward solution: input a channel, load the image blocks, select some, 
        use as context for an image gen model (Google's Imagen flash-image model in this case)
      </p> -->
      <p><b>What feels unresolved?</b></p>
      <p>
        I am tempted to turn it into a social thing, let people share creations back to Are.na & amongst each other. 
        But mostly want to see if different image gen models do it better, or can do it locally instead of via cloud.
